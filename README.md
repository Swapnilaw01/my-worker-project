Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how the above generic Camunda external task worker works:

1. Spring Boot Initialization
When the Spring Boot application starts, it scans and initializes all components annotated with @Component and @Service.
Beans like SendEmailHandler, GenerateReportHandler, and GenericExternalTaskWorker are created and stored in the Spring ApplicationContext.

3. GenericExternalTaskWorker Initialization
The GenericExternalTaskWorker is a @Component, so it's instantiated by Spring.
Spring injects the ApplicationContext into its constructor. This allows dynamic retrieval of beans during runtime.
java
Copy
Edit
@Autowired
public GenericExternalTaskWorker(ApplicationContext context) {
    this.context = context;
}

4. Post-Construct Method Execution
After the GenericExternalTaskWorker bean is fully initialized, the @PostConstruct method subscribeToTopics() is executed automatically.
This method is responsible for setting up the Camunda External Task Client and subscribing to topics.
java
Copy
Edit
@PostConstruct
public void subscribeToTopics() {
5. Camunda ExternalTaskClient Setup
ExternalTaskClient.create() creates a client that connects to Camunda's REST API (defined in application.properties).
It sets the worker ID and lock duration:
java
Copy
Edit
ExternalTaskClient client = ExternalTaskClient.create()
    .baseUrl("http://localhost:8080/engine-rest")
    .workerId("multi-topic-worker")
    .lockDuration(10000)
    .build();
6. Topic-Handler Subscription Loop
The topicHandlerMap is a map of topics to handler bean names:
java
Copy
Edit
private final Map<String, String> topicHandlerMap = Map.of(
    "sendEmail", "sendEmailHandler",
    "generateReport", "generateReportHandler"
);
The forEach loop iterates over each entry and subscribes the client to the corresponding topic using .subscribe():
java
Copy
Edit
topicHandlerMap.forEach((topic, handlerBeanName) -> {
    client.subscribe(topic)
        .handler((externalTask, externalTaskService) -> 
            handleTask(topic, externalTask, externalTaskService))
        .open();
});
This results in two topic subscriptions:
sendEmail -> sendEmailHandler
generateReport -> generateReportHandler
7. Task Handling Logic
When a task is fetched from Camunda, the .handler() lambda function is triggered.
The lambda function calls the handleTask() method, passing the topic, ExternalTask, and ExternalTaskService.
java
Copy
Edit
private void handleTask(String topic, ExternalTask externalTask, ExternalTaskService externalTaskService) {
8. Dynamic Bean Retrieval
Inside handleTask(), context.getBean() dynamically retrieves the appropriate bean based on the topic:
java
Copy
Edit
ExternalTaskHandler handler = (ExternalTaskHandler) context.getBean(topicHandlerMap.get(topic));
For example:
If topic = "sendEmail", sendEmailHandler bean is retrieved.
If topic = "generateReport", generateReportHandler bean is retrieved.
9. Execution of the Handler
The retrieved handler’s handleTask() method is called:
java
Copy
Edit
handler.handleTask(externalTask, externalTaskService);
For example, if the topic is sendEmail, the following executes:
java
Copy
Edit
public void handleTask(ExternalTask externalTask, ExternalTaskService externalTaskService) {
    String email = externalTask.getVariable("email");
    System.out.println("Sending email to: " + email);
    externalTaskService.complete(externalTask);
}
The external task is marked as complete using:
java
Copy
Edit
externalTaskService.complete(externalTask);
10. Error Handling
If any exception occurs during task processing, it is caught and logged. The task is marked as failed using handleFailure():
java
Copy
Edit
} catch (Exception e) {
    externalTaskService.handleFailure(externalTask, "Error", e.getMessage(), 0, 5000);
}
11. Continuous Polling
After completing or failing a task, the worker continues polling Camunda for new tasks associated with its subscribed topics.
The worker will keep running indefinitely until the application is stopped.
Flow Summary
Spring Boot starts and initializes components.
GenericExternalTaskWorker subscribes to topics from topicHandlerMap.
When Camunda assigns a task, the corresponding handler is dynamically retrieved.
The handler processes the task and marks it as complete or failed.
The worker continues polling for new tasks in a loop.
